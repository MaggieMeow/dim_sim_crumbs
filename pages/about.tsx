            We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians and Owners of Country
            throughout Australia and their connection to land, sea and
            community. This project was developed on the lands of the Ngunnawal
            and Ngambri peoples who are the Traditional Custodians of the ACT
            region. We respectfully acknowledge the wisdom, guidance and
            openness of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples who
            have contributed to our work and we pay our respects to Elders past
            and present. We acknowledge that sovereignty has never been ceded
            and that Australia always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land.
